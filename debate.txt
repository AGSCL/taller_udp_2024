Now please welcome the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden. And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let's begin the debate and let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.  President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high.  Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased.  For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then now costs more than $120.  and typical home prices have jumped more than 30%.  What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?  We got to take a look at what I was left when I became president.  than what Mr. Trump left.  We had an economy that was in free fall.  pandemic was so badly handled.  Many people were dying. All he said was, it's not that serious. Just inject a little bleach into your arm.  VRA.  economy collapse.  for a new job.  unemployment rate rose to 15%.  It was terrible.  And so what we had to do was try to put things back together.  That's exactly what we began to do.  created 15,000 new jobs.  and we brought out another.  where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.  there's more to be done.  There's more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble.  I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of household.  We're at a kitchen table.  things weren't able to be met during the month, it was a problem.  price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.  That's why I'm working so hard to make sure.  I deal with those.  and we're gonna make sure that we reduce the price of house.  We're going to make sure we build two million new units.  We're gonna make sure we cap rents so corporate greed can't take over. The combination, what I was left with in corporate greed is the reason why we're in this problem.  In addition to that...  We're in a situation where...  If you take a look at all that was done in his administration.  He didn't do much at all.  by the time he left, things were in chaos.  Literally chaos.  And so we put things back together, we created, I said those jobs, we make sure we had a situation where.  We now.  We write down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people.  to $15.   and it's on the shot.  $400.  No senior has to pay more than $200.  for any drug, all the drugs they conclude, beginning.  next year.  in a situation that's making, and we're gonna make that available to everybody.  All in there.  So we're working to bring down the price around the kitchen table.  And that's what we're going to get.  Thank you, President Trump.  We're the greatest economy in the history of our country.  We have never done so well.  Everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us. We got hit with...  COVID.  And when we did, we  spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929.  by the time we finish. So we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military.  no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good.  But the thing we never got the credit for and we should have is getting us out of that COVID mess.  He created mandates that was a disaster for our country, but other than that we had we had given them back a  a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible.  The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce-back jobs, a bounce back from the COVID.  He has not done a good job. He's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.  Thank you, President Biden.  Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he's the only one who thinks that, I think. I don't know anybody else who thinks he's the greatest economy in the world.  And, you know, the fact of the matter is that...  We found ourselves in a situation where.  his economy.   He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion.  You raise a deficit larger than any president has in any one term.  He's the only president other than Herbert Hoover who's lost more jobs.  than he had when he began.  the idea that he did something that was significant.  and the military.  You know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan.  He didn't do anything about that.  When he was president, we were still finding ourselves in a position where...  you had a notion that.  We were this safe country.  Truth is.  I'm the only president this century.  doesn't have any.  this decade that don't know any truth.  dying anywhere in the world.   President Trump, I want to follow up if I can. Am I allowed to respond to him? Well, I'm going to ask you a follow-up. You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you. I want to follow up. You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S.  How will you ensure that that doesn't drive prices even?  It's not going to drive them higher. It's just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China.  It's going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things. But he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. That's why we had all the jobs.  and the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he's taking credit for bounce back jobs you can do that he also said  He inherited 9 percent inflation? No.  He inherited almost no inflation, and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like...  a bunch of people that didn't know what they were doing and they don't know what they were doing. It was the worst, probably the worst administration in history. There's never been. And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength.  with power.  He got out. It was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life.  President Trump, over the last eight years, under both of your administrations, the national debt soared to record high.  And according to a new nonpartisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt. Well, so far, President Biden, you've approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.  So, former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say.  With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?  Because the tax cut spurred the greatest economy that we've ever seen just prior to COVID. And even after COVID, it was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country.  But we spurred, that tax spurred. Now,  When we cut the taxes, as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that.  We took in more revenue with much less tax.  and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before.  And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet.  the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with.  We gave him something great. Remember, more people died.  under his administration.  even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it, something which a lot of people don't like to talk about. But he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster, mandating it.  The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine.  And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job. And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership. They don't respect the United States anymore. We're like a third-world nation between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent.  All of the things he's done, we've become like a third world nation.  and it's a shame.  the damage he's done to our country. And I'd love to ask him and Will why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.  President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block. President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.  He had the largest national debt of any president in a four-year period, number one.  Number two.  That $2 trillion tax cut benefited the very wealthy.  What I'm going to do is fix the tax system. For example.  We had a thousand trillionaires in America.  I mean billionaires.  and what's happened.  during a situation where.  they in fact pay 8.2% in taxes.  If they just paid 24 percent.  25 percent either one of those numbers.  They've raised $500 million.  billion dollars.  in a 10 year period.  We'd be able to right wipe out his debt. We'd be able to help.  make sure that all those things we need to do, child kill.  making sure that we continue to strengthen our health care system.  making sure that we're able to make every single solitary.  potion.  eligible for what I've been able to do.  the  with the COVID-19.  Excuse me.   dealing with.  everything we have to do with.  work.   finally beat Medicaid.  Thank you, President Biden, President Trump.  He's right, he did beat Medicare. He beat it to death and he's destroying Medicare.  because all of these people are coming in. They're putting them on Medicare. They're putting them on Social Security. They're going to destroy Social Security. This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they're trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out...  Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence. And it's a shame. What's happened to our country.  in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries, I'm friends with a lot of people, they cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We're no longer respected.  They don't like us. We give them everything they want, and they think we're stupid. They think we're very stupid people.  what we're doing for other countries and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal.  Thank you, President Trump. Dana?  This is the first presidential election.  since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.  This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case.  temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho.  despite that state's restrictive ban.  former President Trump.  you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states. Correct.  However...  the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access  to abortion pills.  They're used in about two thirds of all abortion.  As president, would you block abortion medication?  First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion bill.  And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.  And if you look at this whole question that you're asking...  complex but not really complex. Fifty-one years ago...  You had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states. Everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives.  Everybody wanted it back, religious leaders.  And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court.  and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade.  and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.  Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many this, getting into other things. But every legal scholar...  throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that.  Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was an end result, that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas, I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they're all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That's the vote of the people.  Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes.  And frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions. Some people, you have to follow your heart. Some people don't believe in that.  but I believe in the exceptions for.  rape incest and the life of the mother. I think it's very important.  Some people don't follow your heart, but...  You have to get elected also.  because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected.  The problem they have is they're radical, because they will...  take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth. After birth, if you look at the former governor of Virginia...  He was willing to do this. He said, we'll put the baby aside, and we'll determine what we do with the baby, meaning we'll kill the baby.  What happened is we brought it back to the states, and the country is now coming together on this issue. It's been a great thing.  Thank you. President Biden? It's been a terrible f-  The fact is that the vast majority of counselors and scholars supported Roe when it was decided.   And that was this idea that they were all against it. It's just ridiculous.  And this is the guy who says the state should be able to have it. We're in a state.  We're in six weeks.  You don't even know whether you're pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor have your.  and have him decide on what your circumstances are when you need help.  The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying we're going to turn civil rights back to the state.  that each state have a different role.  Look, there's so many young women who have been, including a young woman who just was murdered.  and he went to the funeral.  The idea that...  She was murdered by an immigrant.  coming in.  Talk about that.  But here's the deal.  There's a lot of young women to be raped by their parents.  by their in-laws, by their...  by the mother's spouse.  brothers and sisters.  Bye.  It's just ridiculous.  and they can do nothing about it.  and they tried to arrest him when they crossed state lines. Thank you.  There have been many young women murdered.  by the same people he allows to come across our border.  We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world. Consider the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.  And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country.  and they are raping and killing women.  And it's a terrible thing. As far as the abortion is concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting.  In many cases, it's frankly a very liberal decision. In many cases, it's the opposite.  But they're voting, and it's bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted.  including the founders if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn't.  But they would have been everybody wanted brought back. Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn't able to get it. Everybody wanted it brought back. And many presidents had tried to get it back.  I was the one to do it. And again, this gives it the vote of the people, and that's where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way.  Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden, seven states...  I'll let you do that. This is the same topic. Seven states.  have no legal restrictions.  on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion.  Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy? I support Roe v. Wade.   first time is between the woman and the doctor.  Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation.  third time is between.  the doctor.  I mean, between the women and the state.  The idea that the politicians...  Founders, one of the politicians.  to be the ones making decisions about women's health is ridiculous.  That's the last. No politician should be making it.  A doctor should be making those.  That's how it should be run.  That's what you're going to do. And if I'm elected, I'm going to restore Roe v. Wade.  he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month.  and even after birth because some states Democrat run.  Take it after birth. Again, the former governor of Virginia.  put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it. So he's willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.  Nobody wants that to happen, Democrat or Republican. Nobody wants it to happen.  is simply not true.  the Roe v. Wade does not provide for that.  That's not the circumstance. Only if a woman's life is in danger, she's going to die. That's the only circumstance in which that can happen.  but we are not for late-term abortion, period.   Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion.  You can do whatever you want, depending on the state. You can do whatever you want.  We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans. For 51 years, that was the law. 51 years, Constance of Scholarship said it was the right way to go.  51 years and it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. He takes credit for taking it away.  What's he going to do? What's he going to do, in fact, if  If the MAGA Republicans, he gets elected and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress.  and they pass on universal ban on abortion period.  across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or 10 weeks, something very, very conservative.  If you're going to sign that bill, I'll veto it.  He'll sign.  Thank you.  Let's turn now to the issue of immigration and border security. President Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch.  overwhelming border states.  and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago, and in some cases, causing real safety and security concern.  Given that, why should voters trust you?  to solve this crisis.  Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only.  change all of that.  made sure that we are in a situation where.  you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police that are announced.  we significantly increase the number of asylum-officers.  Significantly, by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me.  endorsed my position.  In addition to that, we find ourselves in a situation where  When he was president, he was separating babies.  from their mothers, put him in cages.  making sure the families were separated.  That's not the right way to go.  what I've done since I've changed the law, what's happened.  I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where...  40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.  better than what he left off.  and I'm going to continue to move until we get the total band.  on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more border patrol and more.   President Trump.  I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either. Look.  We had the safest border in the history of our country.  The board, all he had to do is leave it. All he had to do is leave it.  He decided to open up our border, open up our country to...  people that are  from prisons.  people that are from mental institutions in St. Louis.  Terrorists. We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists, all over the world. Not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East everywhere. All over the world, they're pouring in.  And this guy...  just left it open. And he didn't need legislation, because I didn't have legislation. I said close the border. We had the safest border in history. In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol, who is great, and by the way, who endorsed me for president, but I won't say that.  if they endorse me for president.  Brandon, just speak to him.  But look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There's never been anything like it. And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans. Thank you, President Trump. President Biden.  The only terrorist who's done anything crossing the border.  one who came along and killed three underneath administration.  kill an al Qaeda person coming in and his administration.  Kill three.  American soldiers.  kill three American soldiers.  That's the only terrorists that's there. I'm not saying that no terrorists ever got there, but the idea they're emptying their prisons, we're welcoming these people. That's simply not true. There is no data.  Once again, he's exaggerating. He's lying.  President Trump, staying on the topic of immigration, you've said that you're going to carry out quote the largest domestic deportation operation in American history unquote. Does that mean that you will deport every undocumented immigrant in America, including those who have jobs, including those whose spouses are citizens and including those who have lived here for decades? And if so, how will you do it?  Just one second, he said we killed three people.  The people we killed are...  Lbag Daddy.  and Salomeini, the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world. And it had a huge impact on everything, not just border, on everything.  He's the one that killed people with the bad water, including...  hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in.  We are living right now in a rat's nest. They're killing our people in New York, in California, and every state in the union, because we don't have borders anymore. Every state is now a border.  and because of his ridiculous  insane and very stupid policies.  People are coming in and they're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen. We call it migrant crime.  I call it Biden migrant crime.  They're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen before. And you're reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days.  One of them had just spoke to the mother.  and  They just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old. This is horrible, what's taken place. What's taken place in our country.  We're literally...  an uncivilized country now.  He doesn't want it to be. He just doesn't know. He opened the borders. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And we have to get a lot of these people out, and we have to get them out fast, because they're going to destroy our country. Just take a look at where they're living.  They're living in luxury hotels.  in New York City and other places.  Our veterans are on the street. They're dying because he doesn't care about our veterans. He doesn't care. He doesn't like the military at all.  and he doesn't care about our veterans. Nobody been worse. I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA.  He is the worst. He's gotten rid of all the things that I approved. Choice, that I got through Congress, all of the different things I approved.  They abandoned.  We had by far the highest, and now it's down in less than half.  because he's done all these great things that we did.  And I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy.  But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing all of these people to come in. And it's a very sad day in America. President Biden, you have the mic. Every single thing he said is a lie.  every single one.  For example.  Veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PAC.  One million of them now have insurance and their families have.  their families have it because what happens.  whether it was Agent Orange or Burn Pit.  They're all being covered now.  and he opposed his.   We're also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My son spent a year in Iraq.  leaving one next to one of those burn pits came back with.  states for glioblastoma.  I was recently in France.  for a D-Day.  and I spoke to all about those heroes that died.  I went to the World War II cemetery.  where we'll once have to refuse to go to.  He was standing with his four-star general.  And he told me, he said, I don't want to go in there because they're a bunch of losers and suckers.  My son was not a loser, he was not a sucker. You're the sucker, you're the loser.  President Trump.  First of all, that was a made-up quote, suckers and losers. They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that's failing, like many of these magazines.  He made that up. He put it in commercials. We've notified him. We had 19 people that said I didn't say it. And think of this.  Who would say I'm at a cemetery or I'm talking about our veterans? Because nobody's taking better care. I'm so glad this came up and he brought it up.  There's nobody that's taking better care of ourselves than I have.  to think that I would, in front of generals and others, say, suckers and losers. We have 19 people that said it was never said by me.  It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up.  Just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking, it's the same thing. 51 intelligence agents said...  that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn't. That came from his son, Hunter.  It wasn't Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers story. He should apologize to me right now.  The four-star general standing your side was on your staff who said you said it.  Period.  That's number one.  And number two, the idea.  the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything.  along the line.  We've done more for veterans than any president has in American history.  American history.  and they now are in their family. The only sacred obligation we have is the country.  is to care for our veterans when they come home and their families and equip them when they go to war.  That's what we're doing. That's what the VA is doing now.  they're doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.  All right, thank you so much.  topic of foreign policy. I want to begin with Russia's war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year.  Former President Trump.  Russian President Vladimir Putin says he'll only end this war.  If Russia keeps the Ukrainian territory, it is already claimed.  and Ukraine abandoned.  It's bid to join NATO.  Are Putin's terms acceptable to you?  First of all.  Our veterans and our soldiers can't stand this guy.  They can't stand.  they think he's the worst commander in chief, if that's what you call him.  that we've ever had. They can't stand it.  So let's get that straight.  and they liked me more than just about any of them.  And that's based on every single bit of information.  as far as Russia and Ukraine.  If we had a real president, a president that knew, that was respected by Putin.  He would have never invaded Ukraine.  A lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know. You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers.  He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.  I tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan. It was such a horrible  embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.  that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned. So he's got no love lost.  But he should have fired those generals. No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind. We lost 13 beautiful soldiers, and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind, too. We left American citizens behind. When Putin saw that, he said,  You know what? I think we're going to go in and maybe take my — this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded —  Ukraine never.  just like Israel would have never been invaded.  in a million years by Hamas.  You know why?  Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn't let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror. That's why you had no terror at all.  during my administration.  This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.  President Biden.  Never heard so much malarkey in my whole life. Look, the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where let's take the last point first.  Iran attacked American troops.  kill or cause brain damage.  for a number of these children.  and he did nothing about it recently, not when he was president.  they attack.  He said, they're just having headaches. That's all it is.  He didn't do a thing.  when the attack took place, number one.  Number two.  We got over 100,000 Americans and others out.  of Afghanistan.  during that airline.  Number three.  found ourselves in a situation where  Take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine.  This guy told Trump.  Do whatever you want.  and do whatever you want.  And that's exactly what Trump did.  to Putin, encourage him, do whatever you want. And he went in and listened to what he said when he went in.  He was going to take Kiev in five days, remember? Because it's part of the old Soviet Union. That's what he wanted to reestablish.  key.  And he, in fact, didn't do it at all. He didn't, wasn't able to get it done. And they've lost over, they've lost thousands and thousands of troops.  500,000. Thank you.  President Trump, if I could come back to you for one minute, I just want to go back to my original question, which is, are Putin's terms acceptable to you, keeping the territory in Ukraine? No, they're not acceptable. No, they're not acceptable.  But look.  This is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war.  He led everybody along.  He's given $200 billion now or more.  to Ukraine.  Zelensky comes to this country, walks away with $60 billion. He's the greatest salesman ever.  And I'm not knocking him, I'm not knocking anything.  I'm only saying...  the money that we're spending on this war.  and we shouldn't be spending. It should have never happened.  I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelensky.  As president-elect, before I take office on January 20th, I'll have that war settled.  people being killed so needlessly, so stupidly.  And I will get it settled, and I'll get it settled fast before I take off.  You have a minute.  The fact is that Putin is a war criminal.  He's killed.  thousands and thousands of people.  and he has made one thing clear.  He wants to reestablish what was part of the Soviet empire.  not just a peace that wants all of Ukraine.  That's what he wants. And then you think you'll stop there?  Do you think he'll stop when he takes your crane?  What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries?  And so if you want a war, you ought to find out what he's going to do, because if in fact he does what he says and walks away. By the way.  all that money we give Ukraine and from weapons we make here in the United States, we give them the weapons.  not the money at this point.  and our NATO allies.  produced as much.  funding for Ukraine as we have.  That's why we're strong.  Thank you. Moving on to the Middle East.  In October, Hamas attacked Israel.  killing more than a thousand people and taking hundreds of hostages.  Among those held and thought to still be alive are five Americans.  Israel's response has killed thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  President Biden.  You've put forward a proposal to resolve this conflict.  But so far, Hamas has not released.  the remaining hostages, and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza.  So what additional leverage?  will you use?  to get Hamas and Israel to end the war. You have.  Number one.  Everyone from the United Nations Security Council.  straight through to the G7.  to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed a plan they put forward.  endorse the plan I proposed.  which is three stages.  first stage is trade.  hostages.  for a ceasefire.  Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions.  third faces.  know the end of the war.  The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas.  Number one. You're the only one standing up.  We're still pushing hard.  to get them to accept in the meantime.  What's happening?  in Israel were finding the only thing I've denied Israel.  was 2,000 pound bomb.  They don't work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people.  We're providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.  And by the way...  I'm the guy that organized.  the world against Iran when they had a full-blown  intercontinental ballistic missile attack on Israel.  Noah was hurt.  No one Israeli was accidentally killed.  and it stopped.  We saved Israel. We are the biggest.   support for Israel of any one in the world.  And so that's, there are two different things.  Hamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts.  and our intelligence people.  how they can get a mouse like we did Ben Laden.  You don't have to do it. And by the way, they've been.  greatly weakened tomorrow.  greatly weakened and they should be.  It should be eliminated.  but you've got to be careful for what you use certain weapons.  among population centers.  Just going back to Ukraine for one second.  We have an ocean separating us.  the European nations together.  spent a hundred billion or maybe more than that, less than us.  Why doesn't he call them and say, you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The secretary general of NATO said, Trump did the most incredible job I've ever seen.  They wouldn't have any, they were going out of business. We were spending almost 100% of the money was paid by us.  He didn't do that.  He's getting all — you got to ask these people to put up the money. We're over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them.  because of location, because we have a notion in between. You gotta ask them as far as.  Israel.  and Hamas.  Israel is the one that wants to go. He said the only one that wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one. And you should let him go and let him finish the job. He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian.  But they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian. He's a weak one.  President Biden, you have a minute.  I've never heard so much foolishness.  This is a guy who wants to get out of NATO. Are you going to stay in NATO?  He's going to pull out an 8-0.  the idea that we have.  Our strength lies in our alliances as well.  It may be a big ocean, but we're able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe.  What happens if in fact you have?  and continue to go into NATO.  We have an Article 5 agreement.  Attack on one is attack on all.  You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about, go ahead. Let Putin go in and control.  Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places.  See what happens then.  He has no idea what the hell he's talking about.  And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world.  to support Ukraine.  including Japan and South Korea.  because I understand.  this was this kind of dislocation.  as a serious threat to the whole world peace.  No major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.  President Trump, just to follow up.  Would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state in order to achieve peace in the region? I'd have to see, but before we do that...  problem we have.  is that we spend all the money.  So they kill us on trade. I made great trade deals with the European nation.  Because if you add them up, they're about the same size economically.  Their economy is about the same size as the United States.  and they were written, no cars, no. They don't want anything that we have, but we're supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.  I changed that.  But the big thing I change is they don't want to pay.  And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said...  And he's right about this. I said no.  I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay.  They asked me that question, would you guard us against Russia?  at a very secret meeting of the 28th.  states at that time, nations at that time. And I said, no, if you don't pay, I won't do that. And you know what happened?  Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next month.  But now we're in the same position. We're paying everybody's bills.  Let's turn to the issue of democracy. A former president Trump.  I want to ask you about January 6th, 2021, after you rallied your supporters that day.  Some of them stormed the Capitol to stop the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes.  As president, you swore an oath to, quote, preserve, protect, and defend, unquote, the Constitution.  What do you say to voters who believe that you violated that oath through your actions and inaction on January 6 and worry that you'll do it again? Well, I don't think too many believe that. And let me tell you about January 6.  on January 6th.  We had a great border.  Nobody coming through, very few.  On January 6th, we were energy independent. On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever.  We had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world.  All over the world, we are respected.  And then he comes in, and we're now left at. We're like a bunch of stupid people.  that what happened to the United States' reputation under this man's leadership  is horrible.  including weaponization, which I'm sure at some point you'll be talking about.  where he goes after his political opponent because he can't beat him fair and square.  You have 80 seconds left. My question was, what do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your constitutional oath through your actions and inaction on January 6th, 2021?  and worry that you'll do it again. Well, I didn't say that to anybody.  I said, peacefully and patriotically.  And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watched the news from two days ago.  on tape to her daughter, who's a documentary filmmaker, they say.  But you're saying, oh, no, it's my responsibility. I was responsible for this.  because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard.  and she turned him down and the mayor of  in writing, by the way, the mayor.  in writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C.  They turned it down. I offered $10,000 because I could see I had...  virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech.  I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they're going to be there on January 6. They're going to be there. And I said, you know what? There's a lot of people coming. You could feel it. You could feel it too, and you could feel it.  And I said, they ought to have some.  National Guard or whatever.  and I offered it to her, and she now admits that she turned it down.  And it was the same day she was...  I don't know, he can't be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.  President Biden.  Yeah.  He encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one.  I sat in the dining room off the Oval Office. He sat there for three hours.  three hours watching, begging, being begged by his vice president.  and a number of his colleagues on the Republican side as well.  to do something.  Call for a stop to end it.  Instead, he talked about these people being patriots.  and great patrons of merit.  In fact...  He says he'll now forgive them for what they've done.  They've been convicted. He says he wants to commute to a sentence.  and say that no.  He went to every single court in the nation.  I don't know how many cases.  scores of cases, including the Supreme Court.  And they said...  They said, no, no.  this guy.  is responsible.  for doing what was done. He did do a damn thing.  and these people should be in jail.  and they should be in one, zero, zero, zero.  being held accountable.  and he wants to let them all out, and now he says that he loses again, such a whiner that he is.  That could be a bloodbath.  Thank you, President Biden. President Trump.  what they've done to some people that are so innocent.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself. What you have done, how you've destroyed the lives of so many people.  when they rip down Portland, when they rip down  many other cities. You go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they've done there.  with the fires all over the city. If I didn't bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.  When you look at all of the  They took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that. They saw them coming, and they left.  immediately.  What he said about this whole subject is so awful.  peacefully patriotic. One other thing.  The unselect committee, which is...  basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now out of office.  and Democrats, all Democrats.  They destroyed and deleted all of the information they found because they found out we were right.  We were right.  and they deleted and destroyed all of the information. They should go to jail for that.  If a Republican did that, they'd go to jail. Thank you, President Trump, President Biden. I want to give you a minute.  The only person on this stage is a convicted felon is the man I'm looking at, right?  And the fact of the matter is.  What he's telling you is simply not true.  The fact is that...  There was no effort on his part.  to stop what was going on.  in Capitol Hill and all those people, every one of those who are convicted.  deserves to be convicted.  The idea that they didn't kill somebody just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows.  occupied offices.  turned over desk.  turn them over to statues. The idea.  those people are patriots?  Come on.  when I ask them the first two debates we had, the debates we had the first time around.  I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys?  He said, no, I'll tell them to stand by.  The idea he's refusing to denounce these guys.  We denounce the people we're talking about now.  denounce the people who attacked that capital.  What are you going to do?  I'm going to give you a minute, President Trump, for a follow-up question I have.  After a jury convicted you of 34 felonies last month, you said if re-elected, you would quote have every right to go after, unquote, your political opponents. You just talked about.  members of the select committee on January 6 going to jail. Your main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight. Can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political opponent?  Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We're going to make this country successful again, because right now it's a failing nation.  My retribution is going to be a success.  But when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon.  at a very high level. His son is convicted, going to be convicted probably numerous other times.  should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let  The statute of limitations laps on the most important thing.  But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office. Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he's done. He's done horrible things. All of the death caused at the border.  telling the Ukrainian people that we're going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor Otherwise, you're not getting a billion dollars. Have I ever said that?  That's quid pro quo.  that we're not going to do anything. We're not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor, having to do with the son.  This man is a criminal.  This man, you're lucky. You're lucky. I did nothing wrong. We'd have a system that was rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong. Thank you, President Trump. President Biden, you have said, I'm coming right to you, sir.  You.  Well, you want to respond? Go ahead. I'll give you a minute to respond.  The idea.  that I did anything wrong relative to what you're talking about is outrageous.  It's simply a lie, number one.  Number two.  the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any merit.  just because you're president.  is wrong.  simply wrong. No president's ever spoken like that.  Nope.  in our history.  Number three.  crimes that you are still charged with. And think of all the civil penalties.  How many billions of dollars do you owe to civil families?  for molesting a woman in public.  for doing a whole range of things.  having sex with a porn star.  on the night while your wife was pregnant.  What were you talking about?  You have the moral finale.  Give me a minute, sir. I didn't have sex with a porn star, number one.  Number two, that was a case that was started.  and moved. They moved a  high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan DA's office to start that case. That case is going to be appealed in one.  We had a very terrible judge, horrible judge, Democrat.  The prosecutor, we're all high-ranking Democrats, appointed people, and both the civil  and the criminal.  He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me. But when the public found out about these cases, because they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are.  But when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up, way up. You know that because you're reporting it. And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we've ever taken in in the history of any campaign. I don't think any campaign has ever taken. Hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it's a scam and it's a guy that's after his political opponent because he can't win fair and square. Thank you, President Trump. President Biden, you have said, quote, Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans.  are determined to destroy American democracy.  Do you believe that the tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for President Trump will be voting against American democracy?  The more they know about what he's done, yes.  the more they know about what he's done.  And there's not more coming. He's got a lot of cases around the road coming up.  He's got a whole range of issues he has to face.  I don't know what the jury will do, but I do know he has a real problem.  And so the fact that  Could you ever think you heard any president say?  that I'm going to seek retribution.  You ever hear any president say that?  thought hit right some good ideas. What got me involved to run the first place after my son had died and decided.  in Iraq because of Iraq.  I should have went and run it.  until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia.  people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas.  tortures.  torture.  and singing the same anismatic bio they sang back in Germany.  and the young woman got killed, I spoke to the mother.  And they asked him, they said,  What do you think of those?  people who want to get.  the one who tried to stop it.  And the one he said, I think to find people on both sides.  What?  American president.  whatever shade.  Nazis coming out of fields carrying torches, singing the same management of vile.  Carrying swastika.  find people.  This is the guy who says Hitler's done some good things.  I'd like to know what they are.  Good thing Sittler's done, that's what he said.  This guy has no sense of America.  President Trump.  Jake, both of you know that story has been totally —  wiped out.  because when you see the sentence, it said,  A hundred percent exoneration on this. So he just keeps it going. He says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn't run because of Charlottesville.  He ran because it was his last chance.  He's not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it. It's ridiculous. We have a debate. We're trying to justify his presidency.  His presidency is  without question.  the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country.  We shouldn't be having a debate about it. There's nothing to debate. He made up the Charlottesville story. And you'll see it's debunked all over the place. Every anchor has debunked, every reasonable anchor has debunked it.  And just the other day, it came out where it was fully debunked.  It's a nonsense story. He knows that. And he didn't run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run.  President Biden. And debunked. It happened.  All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time.  and the idea that somehow that's the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy could get elected.  if he thought.  They were good people coming out of that forest, carrying those woods, carrying those torches.  and he didn't deserve to be president.  didn't deserve to be president at all.  and the idea.  and he's talking about all this being fabricated.  We saw with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6th.  We saw the people breaking through the windows.  You saw people occupying it.  his own vice president. Look, there's a reason why.  40 of his 44 top  cabinet officers refused to endorse him.  Vice President has endorsed.  Why?  Why? They know Him well. They serve Him.  Why are they not endorsing him?  Thank you, President Biden. We're going to be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate.  Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia. Let's talk about persistent challenges you both faced in your first terms.  and you'd certainly face again in a second.  President Biden.  While black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, black families still earn far less.  than white families.  Black mothers are still three times more likely to die for pregnancy-related causes.  and black americans are imprisoned at five times the rate  of white America.  What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven't made more progress?  I think knowledge has made a lot of progress, number one.  Facts of the matter is there's more small black businesses.  that have been started at any time in history.  Number two.  of wages of black, black unemployment is the lowest level of spending in a long, long time.  Number three.  We find him in Friday for Friday and housing for black people.  Yeah.  and dealing with segregation.   these corporate.  these corporate operations include.  keep people out of their houses.  In addition to that, we find that...  the impact of on   the  choice.  black families have to make relative to child.  is an incredibly difficult.  when we did the first major piece of legislation in the past.  I was able to reduce.   child care costs.  cut them in half.   We gotta make sure we provide for childcare costs.  You've got to make sure because when you provide that child care protection.  Yeah.  increase economic growth because more people can be in the  in the job market.  So there's more to be done, considerably more to be done.  but we've done a great deal so far and I'm not letting up on that.  You have 49 seconds left.  What do you say to black people?  voters who are disappointed with the progress so far.  I say I don't blame them for being disappointed.  is still hurting the battle.  For example, I provided for the idea that.  any black family.  First time homebuyer should get a $10,000.  to be able to buy their first home.  so they can get started.  I made sure that we're in a situation where.  all those black families and those black individuals.  provided to have to take out student loans.  Everett Poloni.  that a favor and engaged in nursing.  doctor and anything having to do with volunteers.  if they paid their bills for 10 years.  and student debt, all the rest is forgiven after 10 years.  millions have benefited from it.  and we're gonna do a whole lot more.  Black family.  Thank you, President Trump.  And he caused the inflation. He's blaming inflation.  And he's right, it's been very bad.  He caused the inflation, and it's killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody.  It's killing people. They can't buy groceries anymore. They can't. You look at the cost of food, where it's double.  tripled and quadrupled.  They can't live. They're not living anymore.  He caused this inflation. I gave him...  a country with essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his Green New Scam and all of the other — all this money that's being thrown out the window.  He caused inflation.  As sure as you're sitting there.  The fact is that his big kill  on the black people.  is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border. They're taking black jobs now.  And it could be 18, it could be 19, and even 20 million people. They're taking black jobs and they're taking Hispanic jobs. And you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history. Thank you. President Biden.  There was no inflation.  When I became president, you know why?  economy is flat on its back.  15% unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy.  That's why there's no inflation.  time.  or no job.  provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals.  who are involved communities, including minority communities.  we made sure that they have health insurance.  We have covered with the ACA has increased. I made sure that they're $8000 per person in the family.  Get written off in healthcare.  this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again.  and they're going to try again if they win.  find ourselves in a position where  The idea.  that we're not doing any, I've put more.  We put more police on the street than any administration has.  He wants to cut the carpet.  We're providing for equity, equity in making sure people have a shot to make.  There's a lot going on, but inflation...  he caused it by his...  tremendous  No.  in the way he handled the pandemic. Thank you. Another persistent challenge is the climate crisis.  2023 was the hottest year in recorded history in communities across.  The country are confronting the devastating effects of extreme heat.  intensifying wildfires.  stronger hurricanes and rising sea level.  Former President Trump, you've vowed to end your opponent's climate initiatives, but will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?  Let me just go back to what he said about  place.  how close the police are to him.  almost every police group in the nation from every state.  is supporting.  Donald J. Trump.  almost every police group.  and what he's done to the black.  population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. In the 1990s, we can't forget that. Super predators was his name.  and he called it to him for 10, and they've taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.  But when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded and the Opportunity Zones with...  with Tim, as you know, Tim Scott was incredible. He did a great job. Great senator from South Carolina.  He came to me with the idea, and it was a great idea. It's one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country. Opportunity zones.  and the biggest beneficiary are blacks, and that's why.  We have the best numbers with them.  Maybe ever. They're saying ever. I read this morning, wherever. The best numbers.  He's lost.  much of the black population.  because he's done a horrible job for black people. He's also done a horrible job for...  But wait until you see these millions of people pouring into our country, and they're going to take the jobs. And it's already started, and you haven't seen anything yet. It's a disaster. You've...  38 seconds left. President Trump, will you take any action as president?  slow the climate crisis.  So I want absolutely immaculate, clean water.  and I want absolutely clean air. And we had it.  We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever.  And we did.  we were using.  all forms of energy, all forms, everything.  And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever.  And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.  I don't know where the hell he's been.  the idea.  The day that he said it's true.  I passed the most extensive.  It was extensive climate change.  legislation and history.  in history.  find ourselves in by the way.  I'm not a college student.  I came up with $15 billion for HBCU's historic black universities in college.  because they don't have a  They don't have the kind of...  contributors that they have.  build these laboratories in the lab.  Any black student is capable in college of doing any white student can do.  He just have the money, but now they'll be able to get through.  jobs and high tech.  We're in a situation where the idea that...  He is claiming.  to have done something that had the cleanest water.  Clean as water.  He hadn't done a damn thing, but he did.  He put out of the Paris Peace Agreement, the climate agreement.  I immediately joined it.  Because if we reheat for 1.5 degrees Celsius...  at any one point where there's no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change.  and he didn't do a damn thing about it, he must undo all that I've done.  Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars.  and China nothing and Russia nothing and India nothing. It was a ripoff of the United States.  And I ended it because I didn't want to waste that money because they treated us horribly. We were the only ones who were costing us money. Nobody else was paying it to it. And it was a disaster.  But everything that he said just now, I'll give you an example. I heard him say before insolent.  I'm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors. What he's doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in, they want everybody. And, look, I have the biggest heart on the stage, I guarantee you that.  And I want to take care of people. But we're destroying our country. They're taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they're going to be taking over Social Security. He is destroying Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  The idea is that...  We in fact, we were.  or the only ones of consequence.  or not.  We're not members of the Paris  How can we do anything we're not able to do? The United States can't get it.  under control.  one of the largest polluters in the world.  Number one, we're making significant progress.  By 2035, we will have pollution and apps.  We have made significant progress.  and we'll continue to make progress.  You shut up a climate corps.  for thousands of young people to learn how to deal with them. Just like...  Peace.  and we're gonna.  or moving in directions that are gonna significantly change.  the elements of cause of closure.  But the idea...  that he claims that.  He has the biggest heart up here and he's really concerned about  about.  pollution and about climate.  I've not seen any indication.  And by the way, with regard to  prescription drugs.  one company.  agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for one, voluntarily.  I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company...  cannot have to pay. Thank you.  And by the way...  So every day, millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet. For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline.  President Biden, if nothing is done to Social Security, seniors will see their benefits cut.  in just over 10 years.  Will you name tonight one specific step that you're willing to take to keep Social Security solvent? Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share.  Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6%.  of their income.  of their paycheck every single time they get a paycheck from the time the first one they get.  when 18 years old.  the idea that they're gonna...  I'm not gonna either proposing it.  Everybody, they pay.  millionaires pay one percent.  one percent.  So no one after, I would not raise the cost of social security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I began to make the wealth.  began to pay their fair share.  by increasing from 1% beyond.   guarantee the program.  So you still have 82 seconds left. Are there any other measures that you think that would be able to help keep Social Security solvent? Or is that one enough? Well, that one enough will keep it solvent, but the biggest thing will do it.  if we defeat this man.  because he wants to get rid of social media.  He thinks there's plenty to cut and so scared.  He's one of our current Social Security and Medicare.  Both times.  And that's, and if you look at the program put forward by.  the House Republican caucus.    is in fact want to cut it as well.  The idea that...  We don't need to protect our seniors.  is ridiculous.  we put, and by the way...  American public has greater healthcare coverage today than ever before.  And on the AC, as I said.  in a circumstance where  400,000 people.  I mean, 40 million people.  would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition.  only allows them to have that insurance.  is the fact.  that they in fact are part of the ACA.  And by the way, the other thing is...  We're in a situation where we talk about education.  black communities I've raised.  the  number of the amount of money for Pell Grant.  another $8,000. Anybody make an under...  $70,000 you can be able to.  $15,000 toward the tuition.  He just don't know what he's talking about.  Thank you, President Biden, President Trump. So, I've dealt with politicians.  All my life, I've been on this side of the equation for the last eight years.  I've never seen anybody lie like this guy.  He lies. I've never seen it. He can look you in the face. So about so many other things, too.  And we mentioned the laptop. We mentioned Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. Everything he does is a lie. It's misinformation and disinformation.  The losers and suckers story that he made up is a total lie on the military.  It's a disgrace.  but Social Security.  He's destroying it because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they're putting them onto Social Security. They're putting them onto Medicare, Medicaid. They're putting them in our hospitals. They're taking the place of our citizens. What they're doing to the VA, to our veterans, is unbelievable. Our veterans are living in the street.  And these people are living in luxury hotels.  He doesn't know what he's doing. And...  It's really coming back. I've never seen such anger in our country before.  President Biden.  The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before. By the way, when I said suckers and losers, he said.  He acknowledges after that he fired that general.  That journal got fired.  because he's the one that acknowledged.  That's what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it.  Number one. Number two.  the idea that we're going to be in a situation where...  all these millions and millions of way talks about.  illegal aliens are coming into the country.  taking away our jobs.  There's a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world.  the reason why we had the most successful economy.  We're doing better than any other nation in the world.  And by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates you talked about being phony.  of 50 Nobel laureates economists, they all said.  that if Trump is reelected, we're likely to have a recession.  and inflation is going to increase and go up.  And by the way, worst president in history.  159 presidential scholars voted.  him the worst president in the history of the United States of America.  President Biden, thank you so much. Let's turn to the cost of child care, which many American families struggle to afford. President Trump, both you and President Biden.  have tried to address this issue.  But the average cost of child care in this country has risen to more than $11,000 a year per child for many families.  The cost of childcare for two children is more than their rent.  In your second term, what would you do to make child care more affordable?  Just to go back, the general got fired because he was no good.  And if he said that, that's why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn't say it, and they're very highly respected, much more so than him.  The other thing is...  He doesn't fire people.  He never fired.  I've never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You'd pay a price for it. But they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn't put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him.  This guy hasn't fired anybody.  He never first...  He should have fired.  Every military man that was involved with that Afghan  The Afghanistan horror show, the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.  He didn't fire. Did you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that's on the border, that's allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from...  from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed?  Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn't be a debate.  He is the worst president. He just said about me because I said it.  But look, he's the worst president in the history of our country. He's destroyed our country. Now all of a sudden he's trying to get a little tough on the border. He came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit, a little bit, like this much. It's insignificant.  He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters.  And I don't think we just can't let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn't have a chance, not even a chance.  of coming out of this rut.  We probably won't have a country left anymore. That's how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far.  Thank you, President Trump, President Biden. We are the most admired country in the world.  with the United States of America.  There's nothing beyond our capacity.  We have the finest military in the history of the world.  the finest in the history of the world.  No one thinks we're weak.  No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody.  Number one.  Number two, the idea that we're talking about worse presidents. I wasn't joking.  Look it up, go online.  159 or 58 don't hold an exact number.  presidential historians, they've had meetings and they voted who's the worst.  president in American history, one best to worst.  They said he was the worst in all of American history.  That's a fact.  That's not conjecture.  He can argue they're wrong, but that's what they voted.  the idea that he is knowing doing anything to deal with childcare.  He did very, for virtually nothing to talk.  We should significantly increase the child care tax credit. We should significantly increase the availability of the child care.  women and men.  or single parents to be able to go back to work.  and we should encourage businesses.  The whole.  to have child care for children. President Trump, the question was about what would you do to make child care more affordable, if you want to take your minute. Just so you understand.  We have polling. We have other things.  that they rate him the worst.  because what he's done is so bad.  And they rate me, I'll show you, I will show you, and they rate me one of the best, okay?  and  If I'm given another four years, I will be the best. I think I'll be the best.  Nobody's ever  created economy like us, nobody ever cut taxes like us.  He's the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times.  He wants to raise everybody's taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire. So everybody, including the two of you, are going to pay four to five times. Nobody ever heard of this before. All my life, I'd grow up, and I see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business. Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country.  The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it.  President Biden? Look, the fact of the matter is that he's dead wrong about...  He's increased the tarot. He will increase.  the taxes on middle class people.  I said I'd never raise a tax on anybody I'm making less than $400,000.  I did.  this tariff is 10% tariffs. Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say?  That's going to cost the average American.  $2,500 a year more.  because they're going to have to pay the different.  and food.  and all the things that are important.  Number two.  He's in a situation where he talks about how he is.  not raised.  He somehow helped the middle class.  middle class have been devastated.  Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next 10 years.  which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country.  You had the largest deficit of any president in American history.  Number one. Number two. You have not in fact  made any contact.  any progress.  China.  We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010. Thank you, President Biden. You lost on the... Thank you, President Biden. Let's discuss an epidemic impacting millions of Americans that both of you have made a top priority in your first term.  the opioid crisis. And for both of you...  the number of overdose deaths in this country has gone up. Under your term, it went up. Under your term, it has gone up.  Former President Trump, despite the efforts that both of you have made, more than 100,000 Americans are dying from overdoses every year, primarily from fentanyl and other opioids. What will you do to help Americans right now in the throes of addiction who are struggling to get the treatment they need?  finish up.  We now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy.  We have the largest deficit with China.  He gets paid by China. He's a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China.  So I think he's afraid to deal with them or something.  But do you notice he never took out my tariffs? Because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took them away. He can't because it's too much money.  It's tremendous and we saved our steel industries and there was more to come.  But he hasn't done that.  But he hasn't cut the tariffs because he can't, because it's too much money. But he's got the largest deficit.  in the history of our country, and he's got the worst...  The worst situation with China. China is going to own us if you keep allowing them.  to do what they're doing to us as a country. They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can't let that happen. You're destroying our country.  So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left. The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need?  Jake, we were doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two and a half, almost three years of like nobody's ever had before any country in every way.  And then we had to get tough. And it was the drugs pouring across the border.  were  It started to increase. We got great equipment. We bought the certain dog that's the most incredible thing that you've ever seen, the way they can spot it. We did a lot. And we had — we were getting very low numbers, very, very low numbers. Then he came along. The numbers — have you seen the numbers now? It's not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because they — the gotaways, they don't even talk about gotaways.  but the numbers of the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women.  coming across our border. The worst thing I've ever seen.  at numbers that nobody's ever seen under him because the border's so bad.  But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we've ever had by far.  President Trump, thank you, President Biden.  Fentanyl and the byproducts of Fentanyl went down.  from a while.  And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl.  These big machines that roll over everything that comes across the board.  and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together.  bipartisan deal.  more fentanyl machines.  more be able to detect drugs.  or more members of  of agents, more numbers of.  all the people at the border.  And when we had that deal done.  He went, he called his.  Republican colleagues and don't do it.  It's gonna hurt me.   He never argued it's not a good bill.  It's a really good.  We need those machines.  We need those machines.  and we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together.  That's what we have to do. We need those machines.  Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, and again, the question is about.  Americans in the throes of addiction right now struggling to get the treatment they need.  This because this does pretend it to  He ended Remain in Mexico.  He ended catch and release. I made a catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here.  We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing.  It's just like when you have a hostage. We always pay $6 billion for a host- Every time we say it's a hostage.  Now we have a hostage, a Wall Street Journal reporter.  I think a good guy, and he's over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars.  for the reporter. I will have him out.  very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office, I said,  by literally, as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out. He should have had him out a long time ago, but Putin's probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time.  We had two cases. We paid six billion dollars for five people.  I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing.  Thank you, President Trump, Dana.  Let's turn to concerns that voters have about each of you.  President Biden, you would be 86.  at the end of your second term.  How do you address concerns?  about your capability to handle the toughest job in the world.  well into your age.  First of all, I...  that half my career.  being criticized being the youngest person.  politics. I was the second youngest person.  ever elected to the United States Senate.  and now I'm the oldest.  This guy's three years younger, a lot less competent.  I think that just look at the record, look at what I've done, look how I've turned around the horrible situation he left me.  As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs.  or investing in America.  over millions, billions of dollars in private investment.  and enterprises that we are growing.  We've, by the way, we brought an awful lot of people.  the whole idea.  computer chips reached that 40% of the market.  We invented those chips.  and we lost.  because he was sending people.  to find the cheapest jobs overseas and then bring home a product.  So I went to South Korea.  I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States.  And then guess what?  those fabs they call them, to build these chairs.  those fabs pay over $100,000.  You don't need a college degree for it.  and there's billions.  About $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans from all over the world.  President Biden, you have 40 seconds left. Would you like to add anything? Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow...  We are this failing country.  heard a president talk like that.  We were the NBA where I can name me a single major.  country president.  wouldn't trade places with the United States.  all our problems and all our opportunities.  We're the most progressive country in the world in getting things done.  the strongest country in the world.  We're a country in the world who keeps our word.  and everybody trusts them.  all of our hours.  in our op, in our op.  those who he cobbles up to from.  Kim Jong-un, we sent love letters to him, Putin, etc.  They don't want to screw around.  Thank you.  Former President Trump, to follow up, you would be 82 at the end of your second term.  What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve? Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests, I aced it.  Both of them, as you know.  We made it public. He took none. I'd like to see him take one. Just one. A real easy one.  Like, go through the first five questions you couldn't do it.  but I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year.  And you know.  We knock on wood wherever we may have wood.  that I'm in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior. Two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be...  Quite smart, and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. And I do it. He doesn't do it. He can't hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match.  He can't hit a ball 50 yards.  I think I'm in very good shape. I feel that I'm in good shape as I was.  25, 30 years ago. Actually, I'm probably a little bit lighter.  but I'm in as good a shape as I was years ago. I feel very good. I feel the same. But I was willing to take a cognitive test, and you know what, if I didn't do well, I aced it.  Dr. Ronnie Jackson, who's...  great guy when he was White House doctor. And then I took another one, a similar one.  And both, one of them said they'd never seen anybody ace.  Thank you.  President Biden.  You can see he is 6'5 and only 223rd file.  3-2-3-2-5.  Well, you said 6'4", 200.  Well, anyway, that's what you've...  Just take a look at what he says he is.  take a look at what he is.  Look, I'd be happy to have a driving contest.  I got my handicap.  when I was Vice President.  down to a six.   And by the way...  I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag.  Do you think you can do it?  as the sixth handicap of all.  I was eight handicapped.   But I have, you know how many... I've seen your swing, I know you...  Okay, let's not act like children. President Trump, we're going to learn. Let's not act like children.  to a specific concern.  that voters have about you.  Will you pledge tonight?  that once all legal challenges have been exhausted, that you will accept.  the results of this election, regardless of who wins.  Here's a look at your forecast of Kansas Countyfs as well as in Oklahoma  you will say right now that political violence in any form is unacceptable.  Well, I shouldn't have to say that, but of course I believe that. It's totally unacceptable.  And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time.  And also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it's one of the strongest statements you've ever seen. In addition to the speech I made.  In front of, I believe, the largest crowd I've ever spoken to. And I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol.  and in many cases were ushered in by the police. And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine. She said that loud and clear.  But the answer is, if the election is fair, free. And I want that more than anybody.  And I'll tell you something.  I wish you was a great president because I wouldn't be here right now.  I'd be.  At one of my many places enjoying myself, I wouldn't be under indictment because I wouldn't have been his political opponent.  because he indicted me.  because I was his opponent.  I wish he was a great president. I would rather have that.  I wouldn't be here. I don't mind being here. But the only reason I'm here is he's so bad as a president.  that I'm going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again.  We're a failing nation right now. We're a seriously failing nation.  And we're a failing nation because of him. His policies are so bad.  His military policies are  Insane.  They're insane. These are wars that will never end with him.  He will drive us into World War III. And we're closer to World War III than anybody can imagine. We are very, very close to World War III, and he's driving us there. And Kim Jong-un and President Xi of China, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, all of these are Putin. They don't respect him. They don't fear him. They have nothing going with this gentleman. And he's going to drive us into World War III.  You want a World War III.  Let him follow and win and let Putin say, do what you want, NATO.  Just do what you want.  There's a thing called Article 5.  Attack on one is attack on all.  required response.  The idea.  idea. I can't think of a single major leader in the world.  wouldn't trade places with the job I've done, what they've done.  because we are a powerful nation. We have wonderful peace because of the people.  That means because of the American people.  They're capable of anything, and they step up when they're needed.  And right now, we're needing.  We're needed to protect the world because of our own safety as a state.  and again.  You want to have a war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kiev.  Make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border.  then you have a war.  President Trump, as I come back to you for a follow-up.  The question was, will you accept the results of this election regardless of who wins?  Just to finish what he said, if I might.  Russia.  They took a lot of land from Bush.  They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden.  They took no land, nothing.  from Trump, nothing. He knew not to do it.  He's not going to play games with me. He knew that. I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games.  He took nothing from me.  Now he's going to take the whole thing.  from this man right here.  That's a war that should have never started. It would have never started, ever.  with me.  and he's going to take Ukraine.  And you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with — he's got us in such a bad position right now with —  with Ukraine and Russia.  because Ukraine's not winning that war.  He said, I will never settle until such time.  They're running out of people. They're running out of soldiers. They've lost so many people. It's so sad.  They've lost so many people, and they've lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are a thousand years old, all because of him and stupid decisions.  Russia would have never attacked.  President Trump, the question was, will you accept the results of the election?  regardless of who wins, yes or no.  If it's a fair and legal and good election, absolutely. I would have much rather accepted these.  But the fraud and everything else was ridiculous. And if you want, we'll have a news conference on it in a week.  I will have another one of these in a week.  but  I will absolutely, there's nothing I'd rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that.  then I'm running again. I wasn't really going to run.  until I saw the horrible job he did.  He's destroying our country. I would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace.  And again.  No indictments, no political opponents stuff, because it's the only way he thinks he can win. But unfortunately, it's driven up by numbers and driven up to a very high level, because the people understand it.  Let's see what your numbers are when the selection is over.  Let's see.  You're a whiner.  when you lost the first time.  You continued, you appealed and appealed to courts all across the country.  not one single court in America.  said any of your claims had any merit.  state or local.  None.  but you continue to provoke.  this lie.  about somehow there's all this mis-  representation, all this stealing. There is no evidence of that at all.  And I tell you what.  I doubt whether you'll accept it because you're such a whiner.  The idea if you lose again, you accepting anything?  You can't stand the loss. Something snapped in you and your .  We'll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia.   It is now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements as predetermined by a coin toss. We're going to begin with you, President.  Biden, you have two minutes.  We've made significant progress from the debacle that was left.  by President Trump in his last.  find ourselves in a situation where, number one,  We have to make sure that we have a fair tax.  I ask anyone out there in the audience.  anyone out and watch  I think the tax system is fair.  fact is that I said.  Nobody would make it under $400,000. I had a single penny.  increasing their tax.  whole 9 entirety slas  And if I'm reelected, that will be the case again.  but...  This guy is.  increased your tax  the deficit.  Number one.  increased inflation because of the debacle he left.  after when he handled the pandemic.  and he finds himself in a position where  now wants to tax you more.  put in a 10% tariff on everything that comes into the United States of America.  I did.  For example,  He wants to get rid of it.  the ability of Medicare.  you  or the ability.  for you.  to be able to negotiate drug prices with a big pharma company.  Well, guess what?  We got it.  We got it down to.  team.  Excuse me, $35.  instead of $400.  no more than $2,000.  or every senior.  no matter what they're.  how much   You know what that did?  that reduced   debt by $160 billion over 10 years.  because the government don't have to pay the exorbitant price.  I'm gonna make that available to every senior.  all along, and it's happening now.  and everybody in America.  You want us to get rid of that?  We have, I'm going to make sure that we have child care.  We're going to significantly increase.  credit people have for child  We're gonna make sure we do something about it.  what we're doing on.  lead pipes and all the things that are.  causing health problems.  people across the country.  We're going to continue to fight to bring down inflation.  and give people a better life.  Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement.  Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer.  He said, we want to do this, we want to do that, we want to get rid of this tax, that tax.  but he doesn't do anything.  He doesn't do — all he does is make our country unsafe by allowing —  millions and millions of people to pour in.  Our military doesn't respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan.  We didn't stop.  Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened. Iran was broke.  Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States. They all passed. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror. No money whatsoever.  Again, Ukraine should have never happened.  He talks about all the stuff, but he didn't do it. For three and a half years, we're living in hell.  We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place. You talk about Charlottesville.  This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times. The whole country is exploding because of you.  because they don't respect you. And they have to respect their president, and they don't respect you throughout the world.  What we did was incredible. We rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history. The reason he's got jobs is because I cut the regulations and gave jobs, but he's putting a lot of those regulations back on.  all of the things that we've done nobody's ever never seen anything like even from a medical standpoint right to try where we can try space age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you're terminally ill now you can go and you can get something you sign a document they've been trying to get it  for 42 years.  But you know what we did for the military was incredible choice for our soldiers. Where our soldiers.  instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor.  can go out and get themselves.  fixed up and readied up and take care of themselves and they're living. And that's why I had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.  So all of these things, we're in a failing nation, but it's not going to be failing anymore. We're going to make it great again.  Thank you, former President Trump.  President Biden.
